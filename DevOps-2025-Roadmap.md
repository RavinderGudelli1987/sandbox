# DevOps 2025 Roadmap: A Comprehensive Guide

The DevOps 2025 roadmap is strategically structured into **two main parts**: **Required Skills** and **Good to Have Skills**. This division aims to provide clarity for learners on when to transition from theoretical learning to practical job seeking.

While **Required Skills** are considered foundational and crucial for securing DevOps and Cloud jobs, **Good to Have Skills** serve as **bonus or added points to a resume**. The advice is that once an individual has mastered the **Required Skills**, they should begin giving DevOps interviews. The acquisition of **Good to Have Skills** can then continue *while* giving interviews [1]. These skills are not always strictly necessary for landing a job, but in some cases, they might be needed.

## Required Skills (D.A.T.E. Core)

The core required skills are summarized by the **D.A.T.E.** acronym, which stands for DevOps Fundamentals, AWS or Azure, Terraform, and Python (from a DevOps point of view). These are considered the **core things** or **required things** to become a DevOps engineer in 2025.

### D - DevOps Fundamentals

*   **What is DevOps and Why DevOps?**: Understand the core concept and its significance.
*   **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: Comprehend SDLC and how DevOps accelerates it.
*   **Linux Fundamentals**:
    *   Focus on **basic shell commands** (e.g., create files/directories, list files, check system utilization).
    *   Learn to write **simple shell scripts**.
    *   Simultaneously, learn **networking concepts** like the OSI model and TCP handshake.
*   **Version Control System (Git)**:
    *   Learn **Git fundamentals**.
    *   Transition to **GitHub or GitLab** as companies typically use these platforms.
*   **CI/CD Basics (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)**:
    *   Understand what CI/CD is and its different stages.
    *   **Avoid advanced concepts initially to prevent demotivation**.
*   **Basics of Ansible and Terraform**: Learn the fundamentals without immediately jumping into advanced topics.
*   **Containerization (Docker)**:
    *   **Crucially, learn Docker *before* Kubernetes**.
    *   Understand the **difference between VMs and containers**.
    *   Learn **Docker networking and volumes**.
    *   Focus on **reducing Docker image size** and **Dockerfile best practices**.
    *   Learn how to run **multiple containers using Docker Compose**.
*   **Kubernetes**:
    *   Kubernetes is an "ocean," so focus on **important concepts**.
    *   Learn about **Pods, Deployments, Services**.
    *   Understand Kubernetes **networking, service discovery, and Ingress**.
    *   **Deploy a simple Kubernetes project**.

### A - AWS or Azure

*   **Prioritize AWS or Azure for job opportunities**; GCP is a third priority.
*   **Cloud Fundamentals**: Start with concepts like public vs. private cloud.
*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**:
    *   Essential for interacting with cloud services (authentication and authorization).
    *   Learn to create accounts, users, and groups.
*   **Networking Concepts (Cloud-specific)**:
    *   Learn about **subnets, CIDR, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**.
    *   Understand **security groups, routing rules, and DNS**.
    *   Differentiate between public and private subnets.
*   **Compute Services**:
    *   Learn to **create virtual machines** and **deploy applications**.
    *   Manage **volumes** attached to compute instances.
*   **Basic Load Balancing**: Understand different load balancers (L7, L4) and their usage.
*   **Storage Solutions**: Focus on cloud-specific storage like **EBS, EFS, S3, NFS in AWS**.
*   **Advanced CI/CD Implementation**:
    *   Deploy **multi-tier demo applications** (2-tier, 3-tier).
*   **Kubernetes on Cloud (EKS/AKS)**: Implement Kubernetes using cloud-specific solutions after learning basic Kubernetes.
*   **Serverless Computing**: Explore serverless concepts.
*   **Cost Optimization, Security & Compliance, and Monitoring**: These are crucial and often focal points in interviews.

### TE - Terraform (Infrastructure as Code - IaC)

*   A **very important concept from the interviews point of view**.
*   **First priority for IaC** because it is **cloud-agnostic** (works across AWS, Azure, etc.).
*   Learn the **fundamentals of IaC and Terraform**.
*   Understand **Terraform providers** and how to use **multiple providers** in a single project.
*   Master commands: `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`.
*   Learn about the **Terraform State file and State Management**.
*   Explore **Terraform provisioners, variable structures** (input/output), **modules**, and **managing different environments**.
*   **Implement a project with Terraform**, incorporating **secret management solutions** like HashiCorp Vault.

### Python (from a DevOps point of view)

*   A **critical required skill**; interviewers often ask Python-related questions.
*   **Focus on Python's use by a DevOps engineer**, not the entire language (e.g., NumPy or Pandas are not required).
*   Learn **Python fundamentals**: variables, data types, conditions, loops.
*   Understand and utilize **virtual environments** in Python.
*   Focus on **DevOps-specific use cases**:
    *   Making **API calls**.
    *   Interacting with **GitHub actions or webhooks**.
    *   Programmatically **creating Jira tickets**.

## Good to Have Skills

These skills add significant value to a resume and reflect evolving industry expectations.

### Observability

*   Predominantly an SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) skill, but the **lines between DevOps and SRE are blurring**, making it beneficial for DevOps engineers .
*   Involves understanding **metrics, monitoring, logging, and tracing**.
*   **Learn by implementing these four aspects on a demo project**.
*   **Recommended tools (pick one per category or an enterprise solution)**:
    *   **Metrics**: Prometheus, Open Telemetry.
    *   **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana.
    *   **Logging**: ELK stack.
    *   **Tracing**: Jaeger, Open Tracing.
    *   **Enterprise Solutions**: DataDog, Dynatrace, New Relic (choose one).

### AIOps

*   Projected to be a **high-paying skill in 2025**.
*   Involves **using AI to automate IT operations**.
*   **Use cases include**:
    *   Running **AI models locally** (e.g., with Ollama).
    *   **Automating issue resolution** (e.g., diagnosing Kubernetes pod failures using AI analysis of logs, potentially via OpenAI or Llama 3 calls).
    *   **Optimizing Docker image size** by analyzing Dockerfiles.
    *   **Anticipating future issues from metrics/logs** and suggesting preventative steps.
    *   Solutions for **incident management and change management**.
